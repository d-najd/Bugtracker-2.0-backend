This folder contains all the scripts for helping with building stuff

NOTE: when ran from shell the app may not close fully even if you press ctrl + z to stop the instance, closing the
terminal for that instance fixes the issue

all-services and all-services-wait-times are the services that are looked up when "run-all.sh" and "copy-jars" are
called and any services in which are not included will be ignored from being ran.

the jars from all the built services will be copies in folder called jars in the root directory of the project, currently
this has no use

build-all.sh -> takes no arguments, builds all the services in the main pom.xml file, does not read service info from
all-services and all-services-wait-times

build-one.sh -> takes 1 argument (name of the service), builds that service and copies the files to jars folder

copy-jars.sh -> takes no arguments, copies all the jars which are put in all-services file

run-all.sh -> takes no arguments, runs all the jars in all-services file with delays from all-services-wait-times

run-one.sh -> takes 1 argument (name of service), runs one service (does not build it if it does not exist)

run-one-write-logs.sh -> takes 1 argument (name of service), runs one service (does not build it if it does not exist)
and writes the logs in a file with the format { $(pwd)/logs/$1.log }


improvements
- for the contents from pom.xml instead of all-services but the wait times will probably need to be kept preferably in
key value format possibly json
- build the service if it does not exist in run-one and run-all
